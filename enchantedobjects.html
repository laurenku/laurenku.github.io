		<hr>
		In Enchanted Objects, Iâ€™m interested in examining how technologies exist outside of a focus on efficiency, ergonomics, and simplicity and satisfy some fundamental human desires. Through the trials of reviving a Nabaztag, an ambient electronic device that was released on the market in 2006, I engage with a deliberate lack of functionality. Furthermore, I consider the dominant role of cuteness in consumer society by heightening and compromising the cuteness of my Nabaztag.

		This project was supported in part by funding from the Carnegie Mellon University <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/programs/" target="_blank">BXA Intercollege Degree Programs</a>.
		<br><br>
		Title inspired by <i>Enchanted Objects</i> by David L. Rose.

		I designed and sculpted a pair of ceramic, detachable ears for my Nazbaztag. They were made out of clay and magnets, and they have 3D printed connectors to fit with the body.

		Hand sewn sweater with zipper features: ear zippers allow for mobility and detachability of ears; the zipper on the bottom/back allows the sweater to be taken on and off, and makes it possible for the Rabbit to connect to power while the sweater is on.
